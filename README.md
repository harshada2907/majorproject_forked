# 🌊 Optimal Operation of a Single Reservoir System 🌾

🚀 Project Overview

Water resource management is a critical aspect of sustainable development, especially in regions heavily dependent on dams for agriculture, hydropower, and other uses. This project, titled **"Optimal Operation of a Single Reservoir System"**, focuses on the Bhatsa Dam in Maharashtra, India. The goal is to create a predictive system for estimating monthly water releases for irrigation and hydropower generation. By leveraging advanced machine learning models and historical data, this project aims to optimize water distribution while accounting for uncertainties in inflow, storage, and demand.


🔍 Problem Statement

The Bhatsa Dam faces numerous challenges due to:
- 🌧️ Climate variability and its impact on water inflow.
- 👥 Growing population and increasing water demands.
- 🛠️ Inefficient traditional methods for water release prediction.
- 🚱 Risks of water scarcity and reduced agricultural productivity.

This project aims to address these challenges by implementing a robust, data-driven approach to accurately forecast water releases, thereby promoting sustainable water resource management.

🎯 Objectives

1. 📈 Develop a predictive model for accurate forecasting of water releases from Bhatsa Dam.
2. 🤖 Utilize advanced machine learning techniques, such as SARIMAX, for time series forecasting.
